# DataStructures
The goal is to implement the following Data structures in Python

1. Binary Search Tree(BST).
2. Binary Heaps.
3. AVL tree.
4. B-Tree.
5. Binomial Heap.
6. Fibonaaci Heap.

So far Binary Search Tree, Binary Heap is implemented.

AVL Tree is a work in progress(WIP). All WIPs will be available in the Dev Branch.
The work for implementing others will be started soon.


## Implementation Complexity

| Data Structure | Insert        | Delete| Search| Update| DeleteMin| Sort|
| -------------  |:-------------:| -----:|-------|-------|----------|---:|
| Binary Search Tree  |  *O(height)* | *O(height)* | *O(height)*|*O(height)*|NA|*O(n log n)*
| Binary Heap|   *O(log n)* | NA | NA | NA |*O(log n)*| *O(n log n)*|
